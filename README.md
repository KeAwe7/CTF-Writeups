# OSINT CTF Writeups 🕵️‍♀️

Welcome to my collection of **CTF writeups**! 🌐 This repository is where I document my journey through various **Capture The Flag** events, focusing mainly on **OSINT** (Open Source Intelligence) challenges—because let's be honest, OSINT is just pure digital sleuthing fun! 🔍

## What's Inside? 📂

This repo is a growing collection of **writeups**, showcasing how I approach different challenges and the thought processes behind solving them. Every CTF is a learning experience, and OSINT challenges always test the limits of creativity, patience, and digging skills. Here you'll find detailed breakdowns of the puzzles, tools used, and lessons learned along the way.

## Why OSINT? 🤔

I’m fascinated by OSINT because it's like being a detective in the digital world. From scraping hidden details across websites to piecing together data that shouldn't even be there—there’s always an exhilarating "aha!" moment! 💡
